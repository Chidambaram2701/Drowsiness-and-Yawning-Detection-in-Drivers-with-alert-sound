# 🚗 Drowsiness and Yawning Detection in Drivers with Alert Sound

A real-time driver monitoring system that detects signs of drowsiness and yawning using a webcam and triggers an alert sound to help prevent accidents due to driver fatigue.

## 📌 Overview

This project uses computer vision techniques to monitor a driver’s face in real time and identify:

- **Eye closure** (sign of drowsiness)  
- **Yawning behavior** (sign of fatigue)

When signs of fatigue are detected, the system plays an alert sound to notify the driver and help avoid accidents.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🚘 Real-time video processing via webcam  
- 👁️ Detects drowsiness through eye closure  
- 😮 Detects yawning using facial landmarks  
- 🔔 Plays an audio alert when fatigue is detected  
- 📌 Easy to run with Python and OpenCV

## 📦 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 📸 OpenCV  
- 🔊 playsound (or other audio library for alert)
- 🖥️ Computer Vision algorithms
